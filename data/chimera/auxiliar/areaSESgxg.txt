#  Solvent-excluded surface area (SESA) of amino acid residue X in Gly-X-Gly 
#  tripeptide, from supplementary Table S1 (revised) of:

#    Transient protein-protein interface prediction: datasets, features, 
#    algorithms, and the RAD-T predictor.

#  These values may be useful for normalizing areaSES, e.g.
#  Attribute Calculator formula for new residue attribute relSESA
#      residue.areaSES/residue.areaSESgxg
#
#  Notes:
#  - less applicable to terminal residues and residues with missing atoms
#  - applies only to standard amino acids (not MSE, etc.)
#  - Dock Prep could be used to repair truncated sidechains, mutate MSE->MET,
#   but turning off (unchecking) hydrogen addition and other options is 
#   recommended for purposes of surface area calculation
#  - normalized areas may exceed 1.0 because the areas in the Gly-X-Gly
#   reference state are not the maximum possible areas
#  - depending on the definition of the reference state, there may be other
#   equally valid sets of normalization denominators
